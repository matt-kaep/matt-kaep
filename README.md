## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Warm Intro](https://github.com/matt-kaep/warm-intro)
Full-stack web app that maps second-degree LinkedIn connections to identify warm introduction paths to prospects. Built custom backend with LinkedIn profile scraping, relationship strength scoring algorithms, and pathfinding to surface optimal introduction routes. Chrome extension brings value directly in the hands of customers by embedding intelligence into their LinkedIn browsing experience — allowing them to take action immediately with one-click introduction requests, anchoring the product in their existing habits rather than requiring a separate platform.

**Tech:** Python, React, Chrome Extension API, LinkedIn Scraping, Graph Algorithms

### [elevendoc](https://pypi.org/project/elevendoc/)
Open-source Python package that auto-generates documentation, README files, and docstrings using multi-agent AI workflows. Built in early 2024 when agentic architectures were just emerging — saved developers hours of manual documentation work while creating comprehensive, searchable knowledge bases from codebases.

**Tech:** Python, OpenAI API, LLM Chaining, Multi-Agent Systems, RAG

`pip install elevendoc`

### [Medical Image Classification Neural Network](https://github.com/matt-kaep/Medical_Imaging)
Built an end-to-end skin lesion classification system achieving 85%+ accuracy across 8 diagnostic classes on dermoscopic image datasets. Implemented segmentation algorithms from research papers (Statistical Region Merging, U-Net) with custom preprocessing pipelines to handle real-world image quality variations. Combined classical ML (Random Forest) with deep learning (CNNs) in an ensemble approach, demonstrating understanding of when simpler models outperform complex ones on limited medical data.

**Tech:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, U-Net, Random Forest, CNNs

### [InterfaceGAN Implementation](https://github.com/matt-kaep/InterfaceGAN)
Reproduced and extended Stanford's InterfaceGAN paper on controllable face generation using GANs. Developed multiple methods to navigate latent space: trained SVMs to identify semantic directions (age, gender, glasses, facial hair), applied PCA to discover principal components of facial variation, and experimented with linear interpolation techniques for attribute manipulation. Built interactive demo enabling real-time multi-attribute control of generated faces, going beyond the original paper's binary attribute changes to support continuous transformations.

**Tech:** Python, GANs, StyleGAN, Computer Vision, SVM, PCA

### PACT - Personalized Meal Planning App
Full-stack mobile application that generates personalized meal plans, recipes, and shopping lists based on household dietary preferences. Built complete system including: recipe database with nutritional data, web scraping of supermarket websites for real-time pricing, OCR for automated grocery bill processing, and recommendation algorithms adapting to user preferences and budget constraints. Handles end-to-end flow from meal suggestion to optimized shopping list generation.

**Tech:** Android Studio, Java/Kotlin, OCR, Web Scraping, Recommendation Systems
