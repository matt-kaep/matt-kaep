- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Consultant - Data Scientist in a strategy consulting firm
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: RAGs, langchain, APIs 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Data Science, Generative AI, Computer Vision

### ðŸš€ Featured Projects
Here are a few projects that Iâ€™ve worked on:

- [**Medical Classification**](https://github.com/matt-kaep/Medical_Imaging)
  Development of an algorithm with pre- and postprocessing of skin lesion images and implementation of a skin lesion segmentation algorithm
  - Developed segmentations algorithms using classical technics and more sophisticated ones such as SRM (Statistical Region Merging, deep learning)
  - Developed classification methods for skin lesions in 8 different diagnostic classes using random forest or deep learning
  
- [**InterfaceGAN**](https://github.com/matt-kaep/InterfaceGAN)
  - Use of GAN to generate faces of people
  - Implementation of the InterfaceGAN scientific paper: use of SVM to move in the latent space and try to generate faces with specific characteristics (glasses, young/old, ...)
    
- [**elevendoc**](https://github.com/matt-kaep/automated_python_documentation)  
  Creation of a python package (which you can download using pip) that makes API call to openai to generate documentation, Readme and advisory file for your python project
  It also formats the code to the pep8 format

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Here's a list of the main technologies I work with:

- Programming Languages: Python, Java, GIT, SQL
- Frameworks & Libraries: langchain, selenium, beautifulsoup, sklearn, pandas, Flask, Tensorflow, Pytorch
- Tools & Platforms: GitHub, Docker, Pypi, Poetry
